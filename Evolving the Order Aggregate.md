### Evolving the Order Aggregate

As your business grows and changes, the core domain and its aggregates need to evolve to meet new requirements and improve functionality. In the case of an online bookstore, the `Order` aggregate may evolve to include new features, handle new business rules, and ensure better performance and scalability.

Let's explore some possible evolutions of the `Order` aggregate.

### New Requirements and Features

1. **Handling Different Payment Methods**: Supporting multiple payment methods such as credit cards, PayPal, and gift cards.
2. **Promotions and Discounts**: Applying promotional codes or discounts to orders.
3. **Order History and Status Tracking**: Maintaining a detailed history of order status changes.
4. **Split Shipments**: Allowing an order to be split into multiple shipments.

### Updated Example: Order Aggregate

#### 1. Handling Different Payment Methods

We'll introduce a `Payment` value object and modify the `Order` aggregate to handle payments.

```python
class Payment:
    def __init__(self, payment_type, amount):
        self.payment_type = payment_type  # e.g., 'CreditCard', 'PayPal', 'GiftCard'
        self.amount = amount

class Order:
    def __init__(self, order_id, customer, shipping_address):
        self.order_id = order_id
        self.customer = customer
        self.shipping_address = shipping_address
        self.order_lines = []
        self.payments = []
        self.status = 'NEW'
        self.total_price = 0

    def add_order_line(self, book, quantity):
        if quantity <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Quantity must be greater than zero")
        order_line = OrderLine(book, quantity)
        self.order_lines.append(order_line)
        self._update_total_price()

    def add_payment(self, payment):
        if payment.amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Payment amount must be greater than zero")
        self.payments.append(payment)

    def _update_total_price(self):
        self.total_price = sum(line.calculate_price() for line in self.order_lines)

    def calculate_total_price(self):
        return self.total_price

    def get_balance_due(self):
        paid_amount = sum(payment.amount for payment in self.payments)
        return self.calculate_total_price() - paid_amount
```

#### 2. Applying Promotions and Discounts

We'll introduce a method to apply promotional codes or discounts.

```python
class Order:
    # Existing methods...

    def apply_discount(self, discount):
        self.total_price -= discount
        if self.total_price < 0:
            self.total_price = 0
```

#### 3. Order History and Status Tracking

We'll add a history log to track changes in order status.

```python
from datetime import datetime

class Order:
    # Existing methods...

    def __init__(self, order_id, customer, shipping_address):
        # Existing initialization...
        self.history = []

    def change_status(self, new_status):
        self.status = new_status
        self._log_status_change(new_status)

    def _log_status_change(self, status):
        self.history.append((status, datetime.now()))
```

#### 4. Split Shipments

We'll add functionality to handle split shipments.

```python
class Shipment:
    def __init__(self, shipment_id, items, shipping_address):
        self.shipment_id = shipment_id
        self.items = items  # List of OrderLine items
        self.shipping_address = shipping_address
        self.status = 'PENDING'

class Order:
    # Existing methods...

    def __init__(self, order_id, customer, shipping_address):
        # Existing initialization...
        self.shipments = []

    def create_shipment(self, items):
        shipment_id = len(self.shipments) + 1
        shipment = Shipment(shipment_id, items, self.shipping_address)
        self.shipments.append(shipment)
        self._remove_shipped_items_from_order(items)

    def _remove_shipped_items_from_order(self, items):
        for item in items:
            self.order_lines.remove(item)
        self._update_total_price()
```

### Updated Order Repository

The repository may also need to evolve to handle these new features and changes.

```python
class OrderRepository:
    def __init__(self):
        self.orders = {}

    def save(self, order):
        self.orders[order.order_id] = order

    def get(self, order_id):
        return self.orders.get(order_id)

    def find_by_customer(self, customer):
        return [order for order in self.orders.values() if order.customer == customer]

    def get_order_history(self, order_id):
        order = self.get(order_id)
        if order:
            return order.history
        return None

    def get_balance_due(self, order_id):
        order = self.get(order_id)
        if order:
            return order.get_balance_due()
        return None
```

### Conclusion

Evolving the `Order` aggregate involves adding new functionalities, handling new business requirements, and ensuring the aggregate continues to meet the needs of the business domain. By continually refining and expanding the `Order` aggregate and its repository, you can maintain a robust and adaptable system that evolves with your business. This approach ensures that the core domain remains relevant and continues to provide a competitive advantage.
