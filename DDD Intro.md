Sure! Let's break down Domain Driven Design (DDD) for software developers with minimal jargon, using a straightforward example.

### What is DDD?
Domain Driven Design is a way to create software that deeply understands and solves problems in a specific business area (domain). The idea is to collaborate closely with domain experts and use their language to design the system.

### Key Concepts

1. **Domain**: The business area the software is addressing.
2. **Ubiquitous Language**: A common language used by both developers and domain experts to ensure everyone understands each other.
3. **Bounded Context**: A specific boundary within which a particular model is defined and applicable.
4. **Entities**: Objects that have a distinct identity, like a "Customer" in an order system.
5. **Value Objects**: Objects that describe certain characteristics but have no distinct identity, like "Address" or "Money."
6. **Aggregates**: A cluster of entities and value objects that are treated as a single unit.
7. **Repositories**: Ways to access aggregates.

### Example: Online Bookstore

#### Step 1: Understand the Domain
Imagine we're building an online bookstore. The domain involves books, customers, orders, payments, etc.

#### Step 2: Define the Ubiquitous Language
We need to agree on a common language with the domain experts (like bookstore managers). For example:
- Book
- Customer
- Order
- Payment

#### Step 3: Identify Bounded Contexts
We divide the system into clear boundaries where specific terms have specific meanings:
- **Ordering Context**: Everything related to placing and managing orders.
- **Catalog Context**: Everything related to managing books.
- **Payment Context**: Everything related to handling payments.

#### Step 4: Design Entities and Value Objects
- **Entities**: 
  - `Book`: Has an ID, title, author, and price.
  - `Customer`: Has an ID, name, and contact information.
  - `Order`: Has an ID, customer, list of books, total price, and status.
- **Value Objects**:
  - `Address`: Contains street, city, state, and zip code.
  - `Money`: Contains amount and currency.

#### Step 5: Create Aggregates and Repositories
- **Order Aggregate**: 
  - Contains the `Order` entity and related value objects like `OrderLine` (a line item in an order).
- **Repositories**:
  - `OrderRepository`: Handles saving and retrieving orders.

### Example in Code (Simplified)

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, book_id, title, author, price):
        self.book_id = book_id
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.price = price

class Customer:
    def __init__(self, customer_id, name, address):
        self.customer_id = customer_id
        self.name = name
        self.address = address

class Order:
    def __init__(self, order_id, customer):
        self.order_id = order_id
        self.customer = customer
        self.order_lines = []
        self.status = 'NEW'

    def add_book(self, book, quantity):
        self.order_lines.append(OrderLine(book, quantity))

    def calculate_total_price(self):
        return sum(line.calculate_price() for line in self.order_lines)

class OrderLine:
    def __init__(self, book, quantity):
        self.book = book
        self.quantity = quantity

    def calculate_price(self):
        return self.book.price * self.quantity

class OrderRepository:
    def __init__(self):
        self.orders = {}

    def save(self, order):
        self.orders[order.order_id] = order

    def get(self, order_id):
        return self.orders.get(order_id)
```

### Conclusion
In this example, DDD helps us create a clear structure for our online bookstore. By understanding the domain, using a common language, defining boundaries, and designing our system around entities and value objects, we build software that closely aligns with the business needs and is easier to understand and maintain.
