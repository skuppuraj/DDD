### Core Domain Distillation

In Domain Driven Design (DDD), **distillation** refers to the process of identifying and refining the core domain, ensuring it is well understood, cleanly defined, and effectively implemented. This involves distinguishing between the core domain and other supporting domains (such as generic or supporting subdomains) and focusing efforts on the most critical parts of the system that provide the greatest business value.

### Steps to Distill the Core Domain

1. **Identify Business Goals and Priorities**: Understand the primary business goals and strategies. Determine what aspects of the business provide a competitive advantage and align closely with these goals.

2. **Collaborate with Domain Experts**: Work closely with domain experts to gain deep insights into the business domain. Use their expertise to identify key concepts, processes, and rules.

3. **Model the Domain**: Create models that represent the business domain. Use techniques like event storming, domain storytelling, and context mapping to capture the domain's structure and behavior.

4. **Categorize Subdomains**: Distinguish between the core domain, supporting subdomains, and generic subdomains. The core domain is the central focus, while supporting and generic subdomains play auxiliary roles.

5. **Focus on Core Domain**: Allocate the best resources to the core domain. Ensure that the most skilled developers and domain experts work on the core domain to maximize its effectiveness and value.

6. **Refine and Simplify**: Continuously refine and simplify the core domain model. Remove unnecessary complexity and ensure that the core domain is clear, concise, and well understood.

### Example: Online Bookstore

Let's apply the distillation process to our online bookstore example.

#### Step 1: Identify Business Goals and Priorities

The primary business goals for the online bookstore might include:
- Providing an excellent customer experience.
- Ensuring efficient order processing and fulfillment.
- Offering personalized recommendations to increase sales.

#### Step 2: Collaborate with Domain Experts

Work with stakeholders like product managers, sales representatives, and customer service teams to understand the key aspects of the business. Identify critical pain points and opportunities for improvement.

#### Step 3: Model the Domain

Use event storming to capture the flow of events in the bookstore, from browsing books to placing orders and receiving shipments. Create context maps to visualize the relationships between different parts of the system.

#### Step 4: Categorize Subdomains

- **Core Domain**: Ordering System
  - Order Placement
  - Order Processing
  - Order Tracking
- **Supporting Subdomains**: 
  - Inventory Management
  - Customer Management
- **Generic Subdomains**: 
  - Payment Processing
  - Shipping Integration

#### Step 5: Focus on Core Domain

Allocate the most skilled developers and domain experts to work on the ordering system. Ensure that this team understands the critical business rules and can implement them effectively.

#### Step 6: Refine and Simplify

Continuously refine the ordering system to ensure it remains aligned with business goals and provides a competitive advantage. Simplify the model by removing unnecessary complexity and ensuring that the core domain remains focused and effective.

### Evolving and Distilling the Core Domain

As the business evolves, the core domain may also change. Regularly revisit the distillation process to ensure that the core domain remains aligned with business priorities and continues to provide the greatest value. This ongoing process of distillation ensures that the system stays relevant and effective in a changing business environment.

### Example: Refining the Ordering System

Let's assume that after an initial implementation, new requirements and business insights lead to further refinement of the ordering system. 

#### New Insights:
- Customers highly value the ability to track their orders in real time.
- Personalized discounts and promotions significantly boost sales.

#### Refining the Ordering System:

1. **Real-Time Order Tracking**:
   - Implement real-time updates for order status.
   - Integrate with shipment tracking services to provide customers with up-to-date information on their orders.

2. **Personalized Discounts and Promotions**:
   - Introduce a discount engine that applies personalized discounts based on customer behavior and preferences.
   - Ensure the discount logic is encapsulated within the order aggregate to maintain consistency and enforce business rules.

#### Updated Order Aggregate:

```python
class Discount:
    def __init__(self, code, amount):
        self.code = code
        self.amount = amount

class Shipment:
    def __init__(self, shipment_id, items, shipping_address):
        self.shipment_id = shipment_id
        self.items = items
        self.shipping_address = shipping_address
        self.status = 'PENDING'

class Order:
    def __init__(self, order_id, customer, shipping_address):
        self.order_id = order_id
        self.customer = customer
        self.shipping_address = shipping_address
        self.order_lines = []
        self.payments = []
        self.shipments = []
        self.history = []
        self.discounts = []
        self.status = 'NEW'
        self.total_price = 0

    def add_order_line(self, book, quantity):
        if quantity <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Quantity must be greater than zero")
        order_line = OrderLine(book, quantity)
        self.order_lines.append(order_line)
        self._update_total_price()

    def add_payment(self, payment):
        if payment.amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Payment amount must be greater than zero")
        self.payments.append(payment)

    def apply_discount(self, discount):
        self.discounts.append(discount)
        self.total_price -= discount.amount
        if self.total_price < 0:
            self.total_price = 0

    def _update_total_price(self):
        self.total_price = sum(line.calculate_price() for line in self.order_lines)

    def calculate_total_price(self):
        return self.total_price

    def get_balance_due(self):
        paid_amount = sum(payment.amount for payment in self.payments)
        return self.calculate_total_price() - paid_amount

    def change_status(self, new_status):
        self.status = new_status
        self._log_status_change(new_status)

    def _log_status_change(self, status):
        self.history.append((status, datetime.now()))

    def create_shipment(self, items):
        shipment_id = len(self.shipments) + 1
        shipment = Shipment(shipment_id, items, self.shipping_address)
        self.shipments.append(shipment)
        self._remove_shipped_items_from_order(items)

    def _remove_shipped_items_from_order(self, items):
        for item in items:
            self.order_lines.remove(item)
        self._update_total_price()
```

### Conclusion

Distilling the core domain ensures that the most critical parts of the business are well understood, effectively implemented, and continuously refined. By focusing on the core domain and evolving it as business needs change, you can maintain a competitive advantage and ensure that your software system remains aligned with business goals and strategies. This approach leads to a more robust, maintainable, and valuable system.
